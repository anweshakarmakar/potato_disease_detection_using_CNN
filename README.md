Potato is one of the most extensively consumed staple foods, ranking fourth on the global food
pyramid. Furthermore, due to the global pandemic coronavirus, global potato consumption is
expanding dramatically. Potato diseases, on the other hand, are the primary cause of harvest
quality and quantity decline. Plant conditions will be dramatically worsened by incorrect disease
classification and late identification due to which Potato farmers are experiencing significant
financial losses due to numerous diseases. If farmers can identify these diseases early and treat
them appropriately, they can save a lot of money. Leaf conditions can help identify various
illnesses in potato plants. In this project, with the help of convolution neural network we tried to
classify a potato plant by its leaf whether it is healthy or not. Mainly there are three classes Late
Blight, Early Blight and Healthy. According to the confidence each potato leaf has been
classified. A simple CNN architecture is used to train and test the model. Main objective was to
create a user friendly interface which will take leaf image as input and will classify according to the trained
model.
